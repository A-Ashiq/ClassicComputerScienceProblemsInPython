## Other Books in the Series
This is the second book in the Classic Computer Science Problems series by David Kopec and published by Manning. It aims to teach classic computer science problems in a Pythonic way. You may also want to checkout the first book in the series, *Classic Computer Science Problems in Swift*, which covers most of the same problems in a more Swifty way. You can check out the repository for that book on [GitHub as well](https://github.com/davecom/ClassicComputerScienceProblemsInSwift). A reader has also reimplemented the first five chapters of the book [in C++](https://github.com/araya-andres/classic_computer_sci).
